# Newton Euler Dynamics
Currently a lot of Inverse Dynamics is based on Newton Euler Dynamics. The basic idea of Newton Euler Dynamics is in the notes here.

For implementation, there is a very famouse algorithms called recursive newton euler algorithm, detailed in Roy Featherstone's **Rigid Body Dynamics Algorithm**.

I have implemented it [here](https://github.com/guzhaoyuan/ModernRoboticsCpp/blob/03d51d32dd6a7e97ef6616cc4c4bd7452a68bfcb/src/modern_robotics.cpp#L556) using the framework of Modern Robotics Cpp.
